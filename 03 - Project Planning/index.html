<h1 id="case-study">Case Study</h1>
<p>The whole course and all corresponding exercises are based on an overall <a href="block00_Case_Study_1hPush.pdf">case study</a> of a fictitious company named "1hPush". </p>
<p>For this specific block there's an <a href="../pdf_documents/block03_exercise_01.pdf">extension to the case study</a> mentioned above that focuses on project planning, cost &amp; estimation.</p>
<h1 id="exercise">Exercise</h1>
<p>In order to reflect the complexity of thinking required to successfully perform the exercise, all exercises have been categorised according to the Depth of Knowledge (DOK) Level defined by <a href="https://www.synergiseducation.com/blooms-taxonomy-and-webbs-depth-of-knowledge/">Webb's Taxonomy</a>. Furthermore, we have aligned the exercises with the cognitive processes explained in <a href="https://www.depauw.edu/files/resources/krathwohl.pdf">Anderson and Krathwohl's revised taxonomy</a></p>
<p><strong>1. Identify work packages/activities of the project mentioned in the interview and record them in the template.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DOK Level:</strong> Skills and Concepts (DOK 2)</li>
<li><strong>DOK Level Explanation:</strong> Identifying and recording work packages involve understanding the concept and applying it to the specific information provided in the interview.</li>
<li><strong>Anderson &amp; Krathwohl's Revised Taxonomy Level:</strong> Apply</li>
<li><strong>Anderson &amp; Krathwohl's Revised Taxonomy Explanation:</strong> Applying knowledge to identify and record work packages involves using the concept in a practical context</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Think about which additional work packages/activities could still arise in this project and add these to your list.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DOK Level:</strong> Extended Thinking (DOK 4)</li>
<li><strong>DOK Level Explanation:</strong> This task involves generating and predicting additional work packages, requiring a higher level of extended thinking.</li>

<p>Solve the exercise "Identify work packages/activities of the project mentioned in the interview" based on the following Transcript of the CEO: </p>
<p>We have already given this some thought.</p>
<p>We have the problem that processes are not standardized in some areas. Particularly in the area of purchasing, but also when working with the community. So you should hold one or more workshops with Maria and Peter very early on to work out the processes.</p>
<p>At the beginning, however, it is certainly necessary to check again whether we all still have a common understanding of the process map. I would therefore recommend that you schedule a meeting with all the heads of functional areas to check this. I would then start with a kick-off meeting and we should start immediately on that day.</p>
<p>However, before we start analyzing the processes, we should be clear about how exactly we will model the processes and where we will store them. I would discuss this with Christina and Marko.</p>
<p>After that, the process for managing the social media channels definitely has priority. The result is very important to me that we have this early on. Which fits in well with this and before I forget, I've watched the last two videos and we can post them now. If you could please do that and at the same time use our usual social media channels and draw attention to the new video.</p>
<p>We have also said that all processes should be adapted, updated and documented.</p>
<p>This means that you should develop the processes with each functional area in workshops and then ensure that they are known and recognized in the functional areas.</p>
<p>You should start with Peter and Franziska. I would work on this in a workshop. Perhaps there will be useful synergies. Another thing to consider is how we can incorporate a quality check for the modeled processes.</p>
<p>We need to write down optimization potentials for all processes so that we can decide early on which processes we want to automate as part of the project.</p>
<p>This brings me to the next point. We need to work out exactly what we expect from a solution for automating the processes. You absolutely have to discuss this with Marko. Then we need to work out a procurement concept for renting the solution - you know, costs, licenses for workstations, etc. - evaluate different providers, create a proof of concept and then make a decision.</p>
<p>Mike and his team then have to decide which processes to automate. But then they have to be implemented and rolled out. I would also like us to work out in advance how complex these processes currently are, what they cost us in terms of time etc. and what we will actually save.</p>
<p>Can you take this opportunity to add the new product features to the product configurator? I've just had new ones on the table and they're fine for me.</p>
<p>A few more general comments. I would like to meet with you every two weeks for a short bilateral meeting on Friday at 8:00 am.</p>
<p>You should have involved or informed all stakeholders very early on. You would need to clarify their expectations with the other steering committee members in advance - very promptly.</p>
<p>We have already agreed that we want to meet with you every 6 weeks. Please send us all relevant content three days in advance.</p>

<summary>Prompt 2 (Executed on 2023-01-03)</summary>
<p>You act as a project manager responsible for a project to document company wide processes and automate two administrative processes using a process automation software. Based on the following transcript of an interview with the CEO, identify work packages and activities for the project: </p>
<p>We have already given this some thought.</p>
<p>We have the problem that processes are not standardized in some areas. Particularly in the area of purchasing, but also when working with the community. So you should hold one or more workshops with Maria and Peter very early on to work out the processes.</p>
<p>At the beginning, however, it is certainly necessary to check again whether we all still have a common understanding of the process map. I would therefore recommend that you schedule a meeting with all the heads of functional areas to check this. I would then start with a kick-off meeting and we should start immediately on that day.</p>
<p>However, before we start analyzing the processes, we should be clear about how exactly we will model the processes and where we will store them. I would discuss this with Christina and Marko.</p>
<p>After that, the process for managing the social media channels definitely has priority. The result is very important to me that we have this early on. Which fits in well with this and before I forget, I've watched the last two videos and we can post them now. If you could please do that and at the same time use our usual social media channels and draw attention to the new video.</p>
<p>We have also said that all processes should be adapted, updated and documented.</p>
<p>This means that you should develop the processes with each functional area in workshops and then ensure that they are known and recognized in the functional areas.</p>
<p>You should start with Peter and Franziska. I would work on this in a workshop. Perhaps there will be useful synergies. Another thing to consider is how we can incorporate a quality check for the modeled processes.</p>
<p>We need to write down optimization potentials for all processes so that we can decide early on which processes we want to automate as part of the project.</p>
<p>This brings me to the next point. We need to work out exactly what we expect from a solution for automating the processes. You absolutely have to discuss this with Marko. Then we need to work out a procurement concept for renting the solution - you know, costs, licenses for workstations, etc. - evaluate different providers, create a proof of concept and then make a decision.</p>
<p>Mike and his team then have to decide which processes to automate. But then they have to be implemented and rolled out. I would also like us to work out in advance how complex these processes currently are, what they cost us in terms of time etc. and what we will actually save.</p>
<p>Can you take this opportunity to add the new product features to the product configurator? I've just had new ones on the table and they're fine for me.</p>
<p>A few more general comments. I would like to meet with you every two weeks for a short bilateral meeting on Friday at 8:00 am.</p>
<p>You should have involved or informed all stakeholders very early on. You would need to clarify their expectations with the other steering committee members in advance - very promptly.</p>
<p>We have already agreed that we want to meet with you every 6 weeks. Please send us all relevant content three days in advance. </p>
<p>Create a table of all activities and add a column to link its predecessor activity. Order the activities chronologically.</p>

<p>Task: Create a table of all activities and add a column to link its predecessor activity. Order the activities chronologically. Write the project activities using action verbs and concise but detailed phrases including resource responsibilities. Remove activities that are considered as operational activities like adding content or videos to social media or adding new features to the product configurator from the table. Furthermore, try to fill the gaps with additional activities that are not mentioned in the text but make sense in relation to the already existing activities.</p>

The table is an attempt to organize the activities chronologically and show their logical order. Dependencies between activities should be reviewed and adjusted based on project requirements.</p>
</details>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>The evaluation of the response is done according to the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completeness and Correctness of Activities derived from Text:</strong>  We expect to see activities that are well described (i.e., concise, actionable and SMART) and are related to the project objectives. </li>
<li><strong>Distinction between Operational and Project related activities:</strong> The exercise contains some pitfalls and mentions operational activities that should not be planned within the scope of the project.</li>
<li><strong>Correct sequence of activities:</strong> The activities should be in a meaningful sequence (i.e., activities in initiation should be before activities in planning or closing activities should follow after execution)</li>
</ul>
<p>The quality of the answers are compared to the tutor's reference solution and rated between 1 and 10 (1 = lowest quality compared to tutors exercise, 10 = highest quality compared to tutors exercise.)</p>

All activities relate to the project and are relevant within the project scope. Some activities wouldn't be considered as project activities such as considerations about the priority of certain activities or instructions on when to make certain decisions. Furthermore, the AI converts any action that is remotely meaningful hence the response contains activities that are not considered as project activities (e.g., Operational activities that have been mentioned by the CEO on a side note or when to hold meetings and who to involve in the project). The order of the stated activities seems to be random and doesn't reflect any meaningful sequence. Without further specifying the output, the response contains Work Packages and corresponding Activities.</td>

<p><strong>Overall observation:</strong> The initial AI response without adding any instructions based on prior knowledge contains already a very well formatted and formalised list of project activities. However, the AI isn't able to deal with specific caveats that a person with some degree of subject knowledge can eliminate (e.g., distinction between operational/project activities, concise, actionable and SMART formalisation of activities, order of activities). By adding specific instructions to the prompt and highlighting some caveats that can be noted when properly reading the exercise, the AI can produce a response with a very high quality which is extremely close to the reference solution.</p>
