Our power drinks are produced with regional products (where available), they lead to excellent performance enhancements, and they are offered with a wide range of flavours. In any case, all regional products are purchased directly from the producer at \"fair prices\" and the complete supply chain and all sources of supply are shown on our website. We are proud of this. We pursue a multi-channel strategy and constantly improve our service and support, while maintaining low product prices across all channels. Customers can access standard products that are available in stores or in the online shop. A standard product, for example, is the extremely popular combination of lime, mint, strawberry, and guarana in the 0.5 litre bottle. One of the company's USPs is that the power drinks can also be individualised online via a product configurator. Companies as well as private individuals can also customise the cans and bottles in their design. Currently, consumers can choose from 5 different shapes of cans and bottles, and they can have their name, lettering, or picture engraved or printed. </p> <p>1hPush continues to pursue a growth strategy and intends to attract more partners in the retail sector (B2B) as a distribution channel. Furthermore, sales via the online shop (B2C) shall be increased, especially the share of configured products. </p> <p>In order to realise the combination of high service quality and low prices, the requirements for process efficiency are particularly high. In recent months, there has been a growing awareness that the training of new employees is increasingly complex and that, in many areas, especially at the various locations, processes are not clearly formulated. This takes efficiency out of the company. \u2003 2   Company vision</p> <p>\u2022   We are an innovative, dynamic, and future-oriented company that is constantly improving and optimising itself in order to be able to guarantee quality and high service standards at all times. \u2022   Our products are pioneering and meet the highest quality standards. \u2022   Fulfilling the wishes and needs of our customers is at the centre of our daily activities. The dialogue with our customers is central to the further development of our product portfolio. \u2022   Our employees are an essential factor in the success of our company. We offer them a creative and performance-oriented working environment, as well as the opportunity for professional and personal development. \u2003 3   Agreement of objectives Customers \u2022   In the first year, three new companies need to be acquired as customers. At least one petrol station chain must be acquired. [performance objective] \u2022   In the first year, the share of configured products in the online shop is to be increased by 200%. [performance objective]</p> <p>Products &amp; Innovation \u2022   In the first year, two new standard products need to be developed and established on the market. [performance objective] \u2022   In the second year, three new containers (bottles or cans) and 10 additional ingredients in the product configurator are established for product configuration on the market. In addition, the existing products and product configuration options are updated and/or removed from the product portfolio. [performance objective]</p> <p>Workforce \u2022   Every employee gets cross-functionally involved with projects and day-to-day business. [behavioural objective] \u2022   Each employee has attended at least one further training per calendar year. [developmental objective]</p> <p>Communication \u2022   Every three months, a new video with an influencer is published in our social media channels with a focus on our product features. [performance objective] \u2022   In the next 12 months, communication via social media channels is to be carried out via a tool and partially automated. [performance objective] \u2003 4   Functional Areas The company 1hPush is divided into the following functional areas.</p> <p>Functional Area Activity/Task   Expected Added Value Product Development \u2022   Implement customer needs \u2022   Develop production processes \u2022   Create prototypes   \u2022   New, interesting product developments, which aim at customer needs Procurement \u2022   Evaluate and select procurement channels \u2022   Procurement of raw materials / components   \u2022   Provide the necessary production factors \u2022   Partnership with suppliers Production  \u2022   Mass production and individualised products \u2022   Providing the products desired by the customers Marketing and Sales \u2022   Gaining attention of potential customers \u2022   Present a positive company image to the public \u2022   Evaluate and select distribution channels   \u2022   Sales promotion of the products / technology \u2022   Exclusive partnerships \u2022   Positive image of the company in the public Information Management  \u2022   Securing know how \u2022   Evaluation of input  \u2022   Distribution of knowledge \u2022   General management of input and output  \u2022   Know how is made available to the relevant internal stakeholders \u2022   Particularly good inputs are highlighted \u2022   Providing output for various channels, e.g. social media channels Customer Service    \u2022   Supporting customers \u2022   Reacting to feedback    \u2022   Ensuring customer satisfaction IT  \u2022   Procurement and maintenance of all essential IT infrastructures (hard- and software) \u2022   Support in case of IT problems  \u2022   Realization of an efficient work environment supported by a functioning IT Human Resources \u2022   Recruiting employees \u2022   Conducting appraisal interviews \u2022   Dismissing employees    \u2022   The company has the best employees who achieve the business purpose efficiently Finance \u2022   Accounting \u2022   Analyses    \u2022   A healthy financial position not only enables the company to survive but also to grow Facility/ real estate   \u2022   Maintenance of the office space \u2022    Maintenance of production facilities \u2022   Procurement of furniture    \u2022   Clean and well-functioning working environment Table 1: Functional areas \u2003 5   Current situation In the last three years, we have grown massively. We have established ourselves in five countries, we have grown to 73 employees and increased our turnover by 400 %. We are gaining more and more suppliers for our products and the number of B2B customers is also growing steadily. Each national company orders only for itself and there are hardly any synergies between them. In some cases, we still work with Excel lists and even within one organisation there is no uniformity. The communication with the \"community\" is growing disproportionately high and, in the meantime, it takes place via several social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. In the future, we want to listen more to our \"community\" and analyse suggestions that are brought in by the \"community\". It is essential that we become more efficient across organisations. It is essential that we learn from each other and extract the best in the processes of the organisational units and establish it in all of them. This increase in efficiency should enable us to invest more time in the exchange with our business partners and especially with our community. This will enable us to identify needs even better and act more innovatively.</p> <p>In order to better manage communication with the \"community\", a solution is to be procured in the future, which will make it possible to manage all social media channels via this one solution and also to achieve the highest possible level of automated pre-categorisation of content with regard to topics, concerns, etc. This solution must be centrally procured and managed and must be able to analyse the content in four languages.</p> <p>In the future, we want to be able to handle standard processes efficiently, but at the same time, we want to be able to react to our customers' requirements in an agile manner. To this end, we will develop a process competence to minimise frictional losses and establish a common understanding of the processes. We have no time for inefficient processes, we want to invest the time for our customers.</p> <p>Here's the Transcript of the CEO: Extension 1hPush \u2013 Project Objectives and Requirements</p> <p>Transcript of the conversation with Sonja (CEO):</p> <p>Our starting position is that we have grown considerably over the past months. Meanwhile, we have problems designing our processes homogenously. Especially, our processes are \u2013 for no reason \u2013 run completely differently. This concerns, for example, procurement and how we try to gain new suppliers, but it also includes our work with the \u201ccommunity\u201d. We are currently not able to learn from each other, because neither our processes are documented uniformly and they are partially only known by few employees. We definitely need to change that.</p> <p>Additionally, we feel that we are not generating sufficient ideas that are of interest for the market. We wish to improve this in future. The project has several dimensions; on the one hand, we want to establish a uniform understanding of processes, and, on the other hand we want to actively integrate a community into the development of new ideas. This concerns, for example, procurement and how we interact with our suppliers and also includes the feedback of existing customers.</p> <p>Goals of the project are in my opinion: \u2022   Preparation of a process map \u2022   Shared understanding of the process map \u2022   Development of all relevant processes with our business partners \u2022   Shared understanding of the processes \u2022   Development of processes to operate our social media channels \u2022   The maximum duration of the project is 6 months \u2022   The budget for the project is 200\u2019000 CHF \u2022   The relevant stakeholders are involved \u2022   All processes are modelled in BPMN 2.0</p> <p>To obtain a shared understanding of our areas of operation and to clarify how the activities of each employee contribute to value generation, we want to establish a process map. This is an important part of working together efficiently. For this, we need the approval of the stakeholders of all areas of operation. I definitely want to be informed, should this cause any problems. The process map will not automatically lead to a shared understanding, hence it should be implemented in all areas of operation and be communicated accordingly.  </p> <p>At the moment, we are working together with our business partners (suppliers and retailers) at times somewhat unstructured and ad hoc. It will be necessary to define and structure the processes for and of our business partners. We should consider what is specific for each country and what can be a common basis across all organizational units. We should extract \u201cthe best\u201d of all areas and transfer it to all organizational units.</p> <p>Since we are growing strongly, it is important for the training of new employees to be able to work in a quick and productive manner. Thus, we will be able to shorten the time of \u00abonboarding\u00bb in future. Not only new employees should develop an understanding of the processes, but also the existing employees. Within the scope of the project it should be ensured that the majority of employees understands the processes. It is not about restructuring existing processes, however it is about homogenising and documenting them. There will be no further training within the scope of the project.</p> <p>The centre of the project is the development of a common vision across all sites regarding the process of operating our social media channels. This uniform process should be defined in a way so it can be automized with a software solution to a high extent. Especially, media discontinuity shall be avoided and all channels shall be operated through one solution and in four languages. It is very important that we communicate professionally and efficiently with our consumers and especially \u201cwith one voice\u201d. The evaluation and the concrete elaboration of requirements for a general solution, the evaluation of this solution and it procurement, we will develop after this project in a separate project. We will have enough to do with the development of our processes in this project.</p> <p>We have a significant budget for the realisation of the project. We also have a tight time frame of only 6 months. It is important that all relevant stakeholders are involved in the development of the content.</p> <p>In the initial phase, we will not acquire any professional software for the compilation and management of processes. However, the processes are to be documented in BPMN 2.0. The BPMN 2.0 training for employees needs to take place at the very beginning of the project. The idea behind this is that we want to automate more processes in future. Existing processes will not be automated within the scope of the project, however automation potentials may be identified and documented. Regarding the project approach, we remain open, as long as we chose an appropriate method.</p> <p>The process map needs to be integrated into our intranet (SharePoint). Subsequently, all documented processes will be uploaded to the intranet making them available for all.</p> Prompt 1 Response <p>Name of the Project: \"Process Optimization and Innovation Initiative\"</p> <p>Overall Project Objective: The overall objective of the \"Process Optimization and Innovation Initiative\" is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of 1hPush's operational processes, fostering a shared understanding across all functional areas. The project aims to establish a unified approach to process management, particularly focusing on procurement, supplier relationships, and community engagement. Additionally, the initiative seeks to streamline and document existing processes, reduce onboarding time for new employees, and develop an automated, multilingual solution for managing social media channels.</p> <p>S.M.A.R.T.

The word \"Initiative\" in the Project Name is not necessary. The Overall Project Objective is too long lacks any focus with regard to the company objectives. It contains too much information about information mentioned in the CEO's Transcript. However, it is well written and provides a correct description about the project and it's purpose. Without further specification, the output is way too long and besides the name and objective, provides additional information based on the SMART-Methodology. Prompt 2 (Required Knowledge: Medium) 5 4 6 The suggested Project Name is more specific compared to Prompt 1 but still too generic for a suitable project name. The Overall Project Objective is slightly more condensed but still too long. However, it contains important aspects of the primary project objective as well as critical business benefits. Although, the SMART-Methodology is applied, there are aspects such as the timeline that shouldn't be added to an overall project objective. Furthermore, the overall project objective also describes the means to achieve the objective which should not be added. Prompt 3 (Required Knowledge: High) 7 7 3 By adding more instructions the project name is memorisable and implies some business benefits. The first part of the overall Project Objective includes the most important aspects of a good project objective. However, the second part lists many strategic objectives there is no focus on the most important objective that is supported. Especially the last part is completely made up and doesn't relate at all to the companies objectives. <p>Overall observation: Without any prior knowledge and by simply copy and pasting the exercise we are receiving an average response that can already be used as a potential solution. However, slightly more knowledge about the topic doesn't elevate the quality of responses dramatically.

Meanwhile, we have problems designing our processes homogenously. Especially, our processes are \u2013 for no reason \u2013 run completely differently. This concerns, for example, procurement and how we try to gain new suppliers, but it also includes our work with the \u201ccommunity\u201d.

We definitely need to change that.</p> <p>Additionally, we feel that we are not generating sufficient ideas that are of interest for the market. We wish to improve this in future. The project has several dimensions; on the one hand, we want to establish a uniform understanding of processes, and, on the other hand we want to actively integrate a community into the development of new ideas. This concerns, for example, procurement and how we interact with our suppliers and also includes the feedback of existing customers.</p> <p>Goals of the project are in my opinion: \u2022   Preparation of a process map \u2022   Shared understanding of the process map \u2022   Development of all relevant processes with our business partners \u2022   Shared understanding of the processes \u2022   Development of processes to operate our social media channels \u2022   The maximum duration of the project is 6 months \u2022   The budget for the project is 200\u2019000 CHF \u2022   The relevant stakeholders are involved \u2022   All processes are modelled in BPMN 2.0</p> <p>To obtain a shared understanding of our areas of operation and to clarify how the activities of each employee contribute to value generation, we want to establish a process map. This is an important part of working together efficiently. For this, we need the approval of the stakeholders of all areas of operation. I definitely want to be informed, should this cause any problems. The process map will not automatically lead to a shared understanding, hence it should be implemented in all areas of operation and be communicated accordingly.  </p> <p>At the moment, we are working together with our business partners (suppliers and retailers) at times somewhat unstructured and ad hoc. It will be necessary to define and structure the processes for and of our business partners. We should consider what is specific for each country and what can be a common basis across all organizational units. We should extract \u201cthe best\u201d of all areas and transfer it to all organizational units.</p> <p>Since we are growing strongly, it is important for the training of new employees to be able to work in a quick and productive manner. Thus, we will be able to shorten the time of \u00abonboarding\u00bb in future. Not only new employees should develop an understanding of the processes, but also the existing employees. Within the scope of the project it should be ensured that the majority of employees understands the processes. It is not about restructuring existing processes, however it is about homogenising and documenting them. There will be no further training within the scope of the project.</p> <p>The centre of the project is the development of a common vision across all sites regarding the process of operating our social media channels. This uniform process should be defined in a way so it can be automized with a software solution to a high extent. Especially, media discontinuity shall be avoided and all channels shall be operated through one solution and in four languages. It is very important that we communicate professionally and efficiently with our consumers and especially \u201cwith one voice\u201d. The evaluation and the concrete elaboration of requirements for a general solution, the evaluation of this solution and it procurement, we will develop after this project in a separate project. We will have enough to do with the development of our processes in this project.</p> <p>We have a significant budget for the realisation of the project. We also have a tight time frame of only 6 months. It is important that all relevant stakeholders are involved in the development of the content.</p> <p>In the initial phase, we will not acquire any professional software for the compilation and management of processes. However, the processes are to be documented in BPMN 2.0. The BPMN 2.0 training for employees needs to take place at the very beginning of the project. The idea behind this is that we want to automate more processes in future. Existing processes will not be automated within the scope of the project, however automation potentials may be identified and documented. Regarding the project approach, we remain open, as long as we chose an appropriate method.</p> <p>The process map needs to be integrated into our intranet (SharePoint). Subsequently, all documented processes will be uploaded to the intranet making them available for all.</p> <p>Reflect the objectives in relation to the company goals/objectives (if possible) mentioned in the following Case Study: 1  The Company 1hPush The company 1hPush is a company that has been producing power drinks for about 4 years, which push the performance of consumers for an hour. 1hPush was founded in Switzerland and has also been active for two years with production and distribution sites in Germany, Austria, Italy, and France. Our power drinks are produced with regional products (where available), they lead to excellent performance enhancements, and they are offered with a wide range of flavours. In any case, all regional products are purchased directly from the producer at \"fair prices\" and the complete supply chain and all sources of supply are shown on our website. We are proud of this. We pursue a multi-channel strategy and constantly improve our service and support, while maintaining low product prices across all channels. Customers can access standard products that are available in stores or in the online shop. A standard product, for example, is the extremely popular combination of lime, mint, strawberry, and guarana in the 0.5 litre bottle. One of the company's USPs is that the power drinks can also be individualised online via a product configurator. Companies as well as private individuals can also customise the cans and bottles in their design. Currently, consumers can choose from 5 different shapes of cans and bottles, and they can have their name, lettering, or picture engraved or printed. </p> <p>1hPush continues to pursue a growth strategy and intends to attract more partners in the retail sector (B2B) as a distribution channel. Furthermore, sales via the online shop (B2C) shall be increased, especially the share of configured products. </p> <p>In order to realise the combination of high service quality and low prices, the requirements for process efficiency are particularly high. In recent months, there has been a growing awareness that the training of new employees is increasingly complex and that, in many areas, especially at the various locations, processes are not clearly formulated. This takes efficiency out of the company. \u2003 2   Company vision</p> <p>\u2022   We are an innovative, dynamic, and future-oriented company that is constantly improving and optimising itself in order to be able to guarantee quality and high service standards at all times. \u2022   Our products are pioneering and meet the highest quality standards. \u2022   Fulfilling the wishes and needs of our customers is at the centre of our daily activities. The dialogue with our customers is central to the further development of our product portfolio. \u2022   Our employees are an essential factor in the success of our company. We offer them a creative and performance-oriented working environment, as well as the opportunity for professional and personal development. \u2003 3   Agreement of objectives Customers \u2022   In the first year, three new companies need to be acquired as customers. At least one petrol station chain must be acquired. [performance objective] \u2022   In the first year, the share of configured products in the online shop is to be increased by 200%.

[performance objective] \u2022   In the next 12 months, communication via social media channels is to be carried out via a tool and partially automated. [performance objective] \u2003 4   Functional Areas The company 1hPush is divided into the following functional areas.</p> <p>Functional Area Activity/Task   Expected Added Value Product Development \u2022   Implement customer needs \u2022   Develop production processes \u2022   Create prototypes   \u2022   New, interesting product developments, which aim at customer needs Procurement \u2022   Evaluate and select procurement channels \u2022   Procurement of raw materials / components   \u2022   Provide the necessary production factors \u2022   Partnership with suppliers Production  \u2022   Mass production and individualised products \u2022   Providing the products desired by the customers Marketing and Sales \u2022   Gaining attention of potential customers \u2022   Present a positive company image to the public \u2022   Evaluate and select distribution channels   \u2022   Sales promotion of the products / technology \u2022   Exclusive partnerships \u2022   Positive image of the company in the public Information Management  \u2022   Securing know how \u2022   Evaluation of input  \u2022   Distribution of knowledge \u2022   General management of input and output  \u2022   Know how is made available to the relevant internal stakeholders \u2022   Particularly good inputs are highlighted \u2022   Providing output for various channels, e.g. social media channels Customer Service    \u2022   Supporting customers \u2022   Reacting to feedback    \u2022   Ensuring customer satisfaction IT  \u2022   Procurement and maintenance of all essential IT infrastructures (hard- and software) \u2022   Support in case of IT problems  \u2022   Realization of an efficient work environment supported by a functioning IT Human Resources \u2022   Recruiting employees \u2022   Conducting appraisal interviews \u2022   Dismissing employees    \u2022   The company has the best employees who achieve the business purpose efficiently Finance \u2022   Accounting \u2022   Analyses    \u2022   A healthy financial position not only enables the company to survive but also to grow Facility/ real estate   \u2022   Maintenance of the office space \u2022    Maintenance of production facilities \u2022   Procurement of furniture    \u2022   Clean and well-functioning working environment Table 1: Functional areas \u2003 5   Current situation In the last three years, we have grown massively. We have established ourselves in five countries, we have grown to 73 employees and increased our turnover by 400 %. We are gaining more and more suppliers for our products and the number of B2B customers is also growing steadily. Each national company orders only for itself and there are hardly any synergies between them. In some cases, we still work with Excel lists and even within one organisation there is no uniformity. The communication with the \"community\" is growing disproportionately high and, in the meantime, it takes place via several social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. In the future, we want to listen more to our \"community\" and analyse suggestions that are brought in by the \"community\". It is essential that we become more efficient across organisations. It is essential that we learn from each other and extract the best in the processes of the organisational units and establish it in all of them. This increase in efficiency should enable us to invest more time in the exchange with our business partners and especially with our community. This will enable us to identify needs even better and act more innovatively.</p> <p>In order to better manage communication with the \"community\", a solution is to be procured in the future, which will make it possible to manage all social media channels via this one solution and also to achieve the highest possible level of automated pre-categorisation of content with regard to topics, concerns, etc. This solution must be centrally procured and managed and must be able to analyse the content in four languages.</p> <p>In the future, we want to be able to handle standard processes efficiently, but at the same time, we want to be able to react to our customers' requirements in an agile manner. To this end, we will develop a process competence to minimise frictional losses and establish a common understanding of the processes. We have no time for inefficient processes, we want to invest the time for our customers. </p> <p>Provide reasons for your assessment.</p> Prompt 1 Response <p>System Objectives:</p> <ol> <li>Establish Uniform Processes Across Locations:</li> <li>Company Goal Alignment: Aligns with the company's vision of being an efficient and future-oriented organization.</li> <li> <p>Reasoning: To ensure consistency and efficiency in operations across all locations, fostering a unified approach to processes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enhance Idea Generation and Market Relevance:</p> </li> <li>Company Goal Alignment: Aligns with the objective to constantly improve and optimize, meeting high-quality standards.</li> <li> <p>Reasoning: To address the CEO's concern about the lack of market-relevant ideas and improve the innovation process within the organization.</p> </li> <li> <p>Improve Onboarding Efficiency:</p> </li> <li>Company Goal Alignment: Supports the goal of providing a creative and performance-oriented working environment.</li> <li> <p>Reasoning: Streamlining processes for new employee onboarding aligns with the company's commitment to employee development and efficient operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Automate Social Media Channels:</p> </li> <li>Company Goal Alignment: Aligns with the multi-channel strategy and the goal of efficient communication with customers.</li> <li> <p>Reasoning: Automation of social media channels contributes to maintaining a positive company image and ensures efficient communication with the community.</p> </li> <li> <p>Document Processes in BPMN 2.0:</p> </li> <li>Company Goal Alignment: Aligns with the goal of automation and optimizing processes for future efficiency.</li> <li>Reasoning: Using BPMN 2.0 for documentation supports the potential automation of identified processes and lays the foundation for future improvements.</li> </ol> <p>Process Objectives:</p> <ol> <li>Develop a Comprehensive Process Map:</li> <li>Company Goal Alignment: Supports the goal of establishing a shared understanding of areas of operation.</li> <li> <p>Reasoning: A comprehensive process map is essential for visualizing and understanding the end-to-end processes within the organization.</p> </li> <li> <p>Standardize Business Partner Processes:</p> </li> <li>Company Goal Alignment: Aligns with the growth strategy and the need to attract more partners in the retail sector.</li> <li> <p>Reasoning: Standardizing processes with business partners ensures efficiency and consistency in collaborations across different countries.</p> </li> <li> <p>Facilitate Employee Process Understanding:</p> </li> <li>Company Goal Alignment: Aligns with the objective of involving employees in cross-functional projects and ensuring their continual development.</li> <li> <p>Reasoning: Ensuring the majority of employees understand and are familiar with processes contributes to a more efficient and collaborative work environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Develop a Unified Vision for Social Media Processes:</p> </li> <li>Company Goal Alignment: Aligns with the goal of communicating professionally and efficiently with consumers.</li> <li>Reasoning: Establishing a common vision for social media processes ensures consistency and effectiveness in communication.</li> </ol> <p>Additional Objectives:</p> <ol> <li>Identify Automation Potentials:</li> <li>Company Goal Alignment: Supports the goal of automation and efficiency.</li> <li> <p>Reasoning: Identifying potential areas for automation contributes to streamlining operations and increasing overall efficiency.</p> </li> <li> <p>Integration of Process Map into Intranet:</p> </li> <li>Company Goal Alignment: Aligns with the need for a shared understanding of operations.</li> <li> <p>Reasoning: Integrating the process map into the intranet ensures accessibility and visibility for all employees.</p> </li> <li> <p>Conduct BPMN 2.0 Training for Employees:</p> </li> <li>Company Goal Alignment: Aligns with the goal of automation and optimization.</li> <li> <p>Reasoning: Employee training ensures the organization has the necessary skills to leverage BPMN 2.0 for future process improvements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Limit Project Duration and Budget:</p> </li> <li>Company Goal Alignment: Aligns with the need for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.</li> <li>Reasoning: Setting clear project boundaries in terms of time and budget ensures focused and effective project execution.</li> </ol> Prompt 2 (Executed 2023-12-28) <p>You act as a project manager responsible for the project described in the following transcript with the CEO of the company: Our starting position is that we have grown considerably over the past months.

Prompt 3 (Executed 2023-12-28) <p>You act as a project manager responsible for the project described in the following transcript with the CEO of the company: Our starting position is that we have grown considerably over the past months. Meanwhile, we have problems designing our processes homogenously. Especially, our processes are \u2013 for no reason \u2013 run completely differently. This concerns, for example, procurement and how we try to gain new suppliers, but it also includes our work with the \u201ccommunity\u201d. We are currently not able to learn from each other, because neither our processes are documented uniformly and they are partially only known by few employees. We definitely need to change that.</p> <p>Additionally, we feel that we are not generating sufficient ideas that are of interest for the market. We wish to improve this in future. The project has several dimensions; on the one hand, we want to establish a uniform understanding of processes, and, on the other hand we want to actively integrate a community into the development of new ideas. This concerns, for example, procurement and how we interact with our suppliers and also includes the feedback of existing customers.</p> <p>Goals of the project are in my opinion: \u2022   Preparation of a process map \u2022   Shared understanding of the process map \u2022   Development of all relevant processes with our business partners \u2022   Shared understanding of the processes \u2022   Development of processes to operate our social media channels \u2022   The maximum duration of the project is 6 months \u2022   The budget for the project is 200\u2019000 CHF \u2022   The relevant stakeholders are involved \u2022   All processes are modelled in BPMN 2.0</p> <p>To obtain a shared understanding of our areas of operation and to clarify how the activities of each employee contribute to value generation, we want to establish a process map. This is an important part of working together efficiently. For this, we need the approval of the stakeholders of all areas of operation. I definitely want to be informed, should this cause any problems. The process map will not automatically lead to a shared understanding, hence it should be implemented in all areas of operation and be communicated accordingly.  </p> <p>At the moment, we are working together with our business partners (suppliers and retailers) at times somewhat unstructured and ad hoc. It will be necessary to define and structure the processes for and of our business partners. We should consider what is specific for each country and what can be a common basis across all organizational units. We should extract \u201cthe best\u201d of all areas and transfer it to all organizational units.</p> <p>Since we are growing strongly, it is important for the training of new employees to be able to work in a quick and productive manner. Thus, we will be able to shorten the time of \u00abonboarding\u00bb in future. Not only new employees should develop an understanding of the processes, but also the existing employees. Within the scope of the project it should be ensured that the majority of employees understands the processes. It is not about restructuring existing processes, however it is about homogenising and documenting them. There will be no further training within the scope of the project.</p> <p>The centre of the project is the development of a common vision across all sites regarding the process of operating our social media channels. This uniform process should be defined in a way so it can be automized with a software solution to a high extent. Especially, media discontinuity shall be avoided and all channels shall be operated through one solution and in four languages. It is very important that we communicate professionally and efficiently with our consumers and especially \u201cwith one voice\u201d. The evaluation and the concrete elaboration of requirements for a general solution, the evaluation of this solution and it procurement, we will develop after this project in a separate project. We will have enough to do with the development of our processes in this project.</p> <p>We have a significant budget for the realisation of the project. We also have a tight time frame of only 6 months. It is important that all relevant stakeholders are involved in the development of the content.</p> <p>In the initial phase, we will not acquire any professional software for the compilation and management of processes. However, the processes are to be documented in BPMN 2.0. The BPMN 2.0 training for employees needs to take place at the very beginning of the project. The idea behind this is that we want to automate more processes in future. Existing processes will not be automated within the scope of the project, however automation potentials may be identified and documented. Regarding the project approach, we remain open, as long as we chose an appropriate method.</p> <p>The process map needs to be integrated into our intranet (SharePoint). Subsequently, all documented processes will be uploaded to the intranet making them available for all.</p> <p>Task: Based on the project description, develop \u201cSystem objectives\u201d, \u201cProcess objectives\u201d, \u201cAdditional objectives\u201d (4 objectives for each category) and reflect each objective with one of the company objectives (if applicable). For each objective, provide a short reason (1 sentence) why it aligns with the company goal (if applicable). </p> <p>Create objectives within the 3 categories based on the following definition: System Objectives: System objectives describe which properties the project outcome should have. Process Objectives: Process objectives describe the path to achieving the project result, i.e. all requirements and constraints that must be met during the course of the project but are no longer relevant when the project outcome is achieved. Additional Objectives: Additional objectives are not directly determined, but derive from other objectives.</p> <p>Here are a few examples of such objectives by category: System Objective: The waiting time of a customer at the hotline must not exceed 35 seconds. Process objective: The project will be implemented using an agile methodology. Additional Objective: Gain experience working with agile methodologies. As output, create a table with the following structure: Objective Category (System objective, Process Objective, Additional Objective), Objective, Alignment with Company Goal, Reason of alignment with Company Goal.</p> <p>Here are the company objectives: Customers \u2022   In the first year, three new companies need to be acquired as customers. At least one petrol station chain must be acquired. [performance objective] \u2022   In the first year, the share of configured products in the online shop is to be increased by 200%. [performance objective]</p> <p>Products &amp; Innovation \u2022   In the first year, two new standard products need to be developed and established on the market. [performance objective] \u2022   In the second year, three new containers (bottles or cans) and 10 additional ingredients in the product configurator are established for product configuration on the market. In addition, the existing products and product configuration options are updated and/or removed from the product portfolio. [performance objective]</p> <p>Workforce \u2022   Every employee gets cross-functionally involved with projects and day-to-day business. [behavioural objective] \u2022   Each employee has attended at least one further training per calendar year. [developmental objective]</p> <p>Communication \u2022   Every three months, a new video with an influencer is published in our social media channels with a focus on our product features. [performance objective] \u2022   In the next 12 months, communication via social media channels is to be carried out via a tool and partially automated.

However, the objectives most often do not fit with the characteristics of the category and are primarily of type \"System Objectives\". There's no distinction between the different categories.The formalisation of the objectives is good but they only partially reflect relevant objectives of the project. The AI is not able to prioritise objectives that are in line with the scope of the project based on the CEO's transcript but creates objectives that are in line with the overall company objectives. 7 AI is able to identify company objectives based on the text and link objectives with the strategic objectives. The reasoning is fairly good. Prompt 2 (Required Knowledge: Medium) 4 Different Objectives were created and categorised as expected. However, the objectives most often do not fit with the characteristics of the category and are primarily of type \"System Objectives\". There's no distinction between the different categories.The formalisation of the objectives is good and they partially relate to the project goals. Still, there are missing many expected objectives that are important for the project.  Restricting the information in the prompt increased the quality of the objectives. 7 AI is able to identify company objectives based on the text and link objectives with the strategic objectives. The reasoning is fairly good. The strategic objectives and especially the reasoning how the project objective supports the strategic objective is too far fetched. Prompt 3 (Required Knowledge: High) 6 Different Objectives were created and categorised as expected. However, the objectives most often do not fit with the characteristics of the category and are primarily of type \"System Objectives\". There's no distinction between the different categories. Providing a description of each category as well as examples of category specific objectives didn't increase the quality.The formalisation of the objectives is pretty good and they partially relate to the project goals. Still, there are missing many expected objectives that are important for the project. Restricting the information in the prompt increased the quality of the objectives and adding further specification about the project objectives improved the overall formalisation. 8 AI is able to identify company objectives based on the text and link objectives with the strategic objectives. The reasoning is fairly good and the association is more clear.The strategic objectives and especially the reasoning how the project objective supports the strategic objective is too far fetched. <p>Overall observation: When creating the prompts it is key to only provide the necessary information and to clearly describe the expected outcome. By doing so, it is possible without any prior knowledge to create fairly good project objectives that are reasonably well aligned to the company objectives outlined in the exercise. However, the classification of objectives according to the well known IPMA-Standard did not work at all. Even by providing clear definitions and examples of adequate project objectives by category the AI wasn't able to correctly categorise them and to produce objectives related to the categories \"Process Objectives\" and \"Additional Objectives\". </p>"},{"location":"02%20-%20Stakeholders%20and%20project%20management/","title":"Project Stakeholder Management","text":""},{"location":"02%20-%20Stakeholders%20and%20project%20management/#case-study","title":"Case Study","text":"<p>The whole course and all corresponding exercises are based on an overall case study of a fictitious company named \"1hPush\". </p> <p>For this specific block there's an extension to the case study mentioned above that focuses on project stakeholder management.</p>"},{"location":"02%20-%20Stakeholders%20and%20project%20management/#exercise","title":"Exercise","text":"<ul> <li>a.

He certainly has to be involved, because all the new ideas have to be processed and documented somewhere. The systemic requirements for this must be clarified with him. He is a technical person and requires rather detailed requirements. But he has a very good technical know-how and will be important for the project. He will always communicate very directly and openly. He will do positive lobbying for the project if he is convinced but may also work against it if he is not convinced.

Also please mind that Maria will be very positive about the project and certainly can bring a lot of positive input.</p> <p>The Head of Product Development, Production &amp; Innovation Barbara will also have an influence on the success of the project. She has very high standards and is very motivated. She will also appoint a co-worker who will also work on the project. This employee should have experience in creating new products but is very likely to be skeptical regarding external product ideas.</p> <p>I would also address Franziska the Head of Customer Service (B2B) because she has to distribute the products to the customers and is also the first point of contact for such customers in case of problems. She is very positive about harmonizing processes and has been demanding this project for a long time. She is in general very demanding and of course has very high standards with respect to quality for new products and therefore also for the whole new process</p> <p>Michael has the same role as Franziska, but he is in charge of customer service B2C instead. In contrast to Franziska, he is not so that positive about the standardization of processes. Rather, he believes that all B2C sales units know their customers best and should therefore design the processes differently. He will observe everything closely. I would communicate quite intensively with him. And, honestly speaking, if things get a bit complicated with Michael, I would definetly ask Franziska for advices.</p> <p>Surely, also the procurement is important. It has to be very closely involved in the development of new products, because new ideas can only be realized on the basis of procurable technology. The main contact person here is the head Peter. He was one of the main initiators of the project. He observed, indeed, that the procurement processes are very different in the each site. Therefore, he will be one of the most important contacts in this project. </p> <p>Marko is responsible for our information management. He certainly has to be involved, because all the new ideas have to be processed and documented somewhere. The systemic requirements for this must be clarified with him. He is a technical person and requires rather detailed requirements. But he has a very good technical know-how and will be important for the project. He will always communicate very directly and openly. He will do positive lobbying for the project if he is convinced but may also work against it if he is not convinced. Nevertheless, he is a very important employee for us, because he almost alone has managed the previous system and is very important to us. Close and regular contact is very important for optimal cooperation with him.</p> <p>Christina is our first contact person for all technical and non-technical aspects of both our online stores and our product configurator.

CFO (Mike) Medium/High The CFO holds a medium level of power but high interest as financial requirements must be met, and he needs to be kept up to date. Head of Marketing and Sales (Maria) High/High Maria has high power and interest, bringing valuable experience and positive input to the project, especially in communication and marketing aspects. Head of Product Development, Production &amp; Innovation (Barbara) High/High Barbara's high power and interest stem from her influence on the project's success, her high standards, and motivation, including appointing a co-worker to contribute. Head of Customer Service (B2B - Franziska) Medium/High Franziska holds a medium level of power with high interest, as she is positive about harmonizing processes and has been advocating for the project for a long time. Head of Customer Service (B2C - Michael) Medium/Medium Michael has medium power and interest, with a more cautious stance on standardization. Close communication is crucial to address potential complications and seek advice from Franziska. Head of Procurement (Peter) Medium/High Peter has medium power but high interest, being a key initiator of the project and recognizing the need for consistent procurement processes across different sites. Head of Information Management (Marko) Medium/High Marko holds medium power and high interest, being crucial for processing and documenting new ideas, with the potential to positively lobby for or against the project based on his conviction. Technical Lead (Christina) Medium/High Christina has medium power and high interest, being the first contact for technical and non-technical aspects, and having experience in modeling processes for collaborative development. Steering Committee (CEO, CFO, Maria) High/High The members of the steering committee collectively have high power and interest, as they oversee the project, ensuring financial considerations, quality, and effective communication. Business Partners Medium/Medium Business partners hold medium power and interest, as their involvement is necessary for successful collaboration and alignment with project goals. Representatives from each Organizational Unit Medium/Medium Individuals from various organizational units have medium power and interest, providing a broad basis for the project, ensuring its alignment with different departmental needs. IT Specialist (Not explicitly mentioned in the transcript but relevant for information management) Medium/High Given their role in processing and documenting ideas, an IT specialist would have medium power and high interest in clarifying systemic requirements and ensuring optimal cooperation."},{"location":"02%20-%20Stakeholders%20and%20project%20management/#evaluation","title":"Evaluation","text":"<p>The evaluation of the response is done according to the following criteria:</p> <ul> <li>Identified Stakeholders: Are all stakeholders correctly listed as mentioned in the exercise </li> <li>Influence/Interest: Are all identified stakeholders correctly rated by their influence and interest to the project.</li> <li>Reason for rating: Is there a plausible reason for the rating provided</li> </ul> <p>The quality of the answers are compared to the tutor's reference solution and rated between 1 and 10 (1 = lowest quality compared to tutors exercise, 10 = highest quality compared to tutors exercise.)</p> Prompt Exercise b) Comment Exercise b) Prompt 1 (Required Knowledge: Low) 6 AI could identify all mentioned stakeholders in the transcript.

He will always communicate very directly and openly. He will do positive lobbying for the project if he is convinced but may also work against it if he is not convinced.

However, it isn't exactly as expected but already provides a good starting point. Prompt 2 (Required Knowledge: Medium) 5 By providing some instructions on the definition of communication points and action strategies, the AI is able to provide meaningful answers. However, there isn't any strong connection between the stakeholder and the corresponding communication points or action strategies. They seem all very unspecific. Although the response quality could be higher, it is already a very good starting point to fine tune and adjust the details. Prompt 3 (Required Knowledge: High) 8 By providing condensed and summarised information and excluding the actual exercise transcript, the response has a much higher quality and accuracy. Furthermore, the exact specification of what is required increased the quality. <p>Overall observation: Even without any specific instructions, the AI is able to provide rather meaningful and average results. The key to drastically increase the quality of the response is by reducing input (i.e., not pasting the whole exercise transcript) and rather provide selected subsets combined with detailed instructions on what has to be delivered. It is even suggested to iteratively work through certain exercises and reuse the output from previous prompts in newer prompts.

Some activities wouldn't be considered as project activities such as considerations about the priority of certain activities or instructions on when to make certain decisions. Furthermore, the AI converts any action that is remotely meaningful hence the response contains activities that are not considered as project activities (e.g., Operational activities that have been mentioned by the CEO on a side note or when to hold meetings and who to involve in the project). The order of the stated activities seems to be random and doesn't reflect any meaningful sequence. Without further specifying the output, the response contains Work Packages and corresponding Activities.

Furthermore, the AI converts any action that is remotely meaningful hence the response contains activities that are not considered as project activities (e.g., Operational activities that have been mentioned by the CEO on a side note or when to hold meetings and who to involve in the project). The order of the stated activities appears to be mostly correct and represent a meaningful sequential order. There are a few activities that are placed in the wrong order (e.g., \"Clarify expectations with other steering committee members\" which is placed at the very end and should be at the very beginning).Due to the specification of the expected output, the table is concise and represents the exact structure of the exercise template. Some activities do not contain any reasoning (e.g., \"Schedule meeting with all heads of functional areas\" doesn't include any reason for why the meeting should take place.). Some activities are not deliverable oriented, such as \"Prioritize and initiate process mapping for purchasing and community areas\" and could be improved.

All activities relate to the project and are relevant within the project scope. Some activities wouldn't be considered as project activities such as considerations about the priority of certain activities or instructions on when to make certain decisions.

By specifically requesting activities with action verbs and resource information, the activities are much clearer and well described. Still, a few activities do not contain any reasoning (e.g., \"Schedule meeting with heads of functional areas\" doesn't include any reason for why the meeting should take place.). By adding specific instructions, the activities are now much more deliverable oriented and actionable. By requesting the AI to add additional related activities that are not mentioned in the transcript, the response is even better and considers important but not stated activities (e.g., measuring the cost/time of the as-is process and later on measuring the newly automated process) <p>Overall observation: The initial AI response without adding any instructions based on prior knowledge contains already a very well formatted and formalised list of project activities. However, the AI isn't able to deal with specific caveats that a person with some degree of subject knowledge can eliminate (e.g., distinction between operational/project activities, concise, actionable and SMART formalisation of activities, order of activities). By adding specific instructions to the prompt and highlighting some caveats that can be noted when properly reading the exercise, the AI can produce a response with a very high quality which is extremely close to the reference solution.</p>"},{"location":"04%20-%20Process%20Modelling/","title":"Process Modelling","text":""},{"location":"04%20-%20Process%20Modelling/#case-study","title":"Case Study","text":"<p>The whole course and all corresponding exercises are based on an overall case study of a fictitious company named \"1hPush\". </p> <p>For this specific block there's an extension to the case study mentioned above that focuses on process management in particular process modelling.</p>"},{"location":"04%20-%20Process%20Modelling/#exercise","title":"Exercise","text":"<ul> <li>a.\u00a0Read the extension of the case study 1hPush.</li> <li>b.\u00a0Identify the described end-to-end process of 1hPush.</li> <li>c.\u00a0Compile a detailed process schema including the following: process name, customer demand, process steps, and process goals.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"04%20-%20Process%20Modelling/#exercise-a-b","title":"Exercise a) - b)","text":""},{"location":"04%20-%20Process%20Modelling/#prompts","title":"Prompts","text":"<ul> <li>Base Know-How Level \"Low\": Identify the described end-to-end process of 1hPush and compile a detailed process schema including the following: process name, customer demand, process steps, and process goals based on the following Transcript of the CEO: &lt; copy &amp; paste extension of case study&gt;</li> <li>Base Know-How Level \"Medium\":  You act as a project manager responsible for a project to document company wide processes and automate two administrative processes using a process automation software.

Within the context of a Swiss University of applied Sciences employing a flipped classroom methodology and in class exercises, a noticeable shift in student behaviour has been observed. Students overly rely on these tools to complete exercises, diverting their focus away from the exercise content and goals, leading to a decline in the quality of outcomes. It is suspected that they often lack the essential skills to critically assess information accuracy of AI responses and contextualize it within the educational exercise.</p> <p>This paper aims to evaluate the implications of employing ChatGPT in educational exercises. We aim to assess ChatGPT's proficiency in solving such exercises and to illustrate the knowledge prerequisites for formulating effective prompts. We focus on bachelor students in business education, particularly in project management and business process management. For instance, we will analyse various types of prompts and the resulting outcomes from a project planning exercise conducted by students based on an interview with the project sponsor.</p> <p>The research methodology involves an analysis of the results obtained, emphasising on the impact on the learning process. This study aims to review the viability of ChatGPT as a tool for solving educational exercises. Additionally, we investigate potential shortcomings and explore required prompts necessary for achieving good outcomes. Moreover, we examine the broader implications of utilising ChatGPT in educational contexts, reflecting on its effects on the learning process. Specifically, exploring ways educators can enhance student learning through effective exercises with the increasing utilisation of AI in the classroom.</p> <p>This study contributes to the ongoing dialogue on using AI in education by offering insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with ChatGPT's role in solving educational exercises. By addressing the quality of prompts and the subsequent impact on learning, we aim to provide practical guidance for educators and researchers seeking to harness the potential of AI in educational settings.</p> <p>Keywords: Emerging Technologies in Education, AI in Education, AI, Chatbots &amp; Robots, ChatGPT, Educational Exercises, Learning Process, Project Management, Business Process Management.</p>"}]}
