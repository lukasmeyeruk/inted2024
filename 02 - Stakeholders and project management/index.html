<h1 id="project-stakeholder-management">Project Stakeholder Management</h1>
<h1 id="case-study">Case Study</h1>
<p>The whole course and all corresponding exercises are based on an overall <a href="block00_Case_Study_1hPush.pdf">case study</a> of a fictitious company named "1hPush". </p>
<p>For this specific block there's an <a href="../pdf_documents/block02_exercise.pdf">extension to the case study</a> mentioned above that focuses on project stakeholder management.</p>
<h1 id="exercise">Exercise</h1>
<p>In order to reflect the complexity of thinking required to successfully perform the exercise, all exercises have been categorised according to the Depth of Knowledge (DOK) Level defined by <a href="https://www.synergiseducation.com/blooms-taxonomy-and-webbs-depth-of-knowledge/">Webb's Taxonomy</a>. Furthermore, we have aligned the exercises with the cognitive processes explained in <a href="https://www.depauw.edu/files/resources/krathwohl.pdf">Anderson and Krathwohl's revised taxonomy</a></p>
<p><strong>1. Identify all stakeholders and rank them with respect to their influence and interest.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DOK Level:</strong> Skills and Concepts (DOK 2)</li>
<li><strong>DOK Level Explanation:</strong> Identifying stakeholders and ranking them involves more than mere recall. It requires the application of the concept identify relevant people involved in the project and to assess their influence and interest.</li>
<li><strong>Anderson &amp; Krathwohl's Revised Taxonomy Level:</strong> Analyse</li>
<li><strong>Anderson &amp; Krathwohl's Revised Taxonomy Explanation:</strong> Analysing stakeholders and ranking them involves breaking down information into parts and assessing their characteristics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Identify the key use cases related to the stakeholders (What will the stakeholder have to do with the solution once it is developed?).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DOK Level:</strong> Skills and Concepts (DOK 2)</li>
<li><strong>DOK Level Explanation:</strong> This task involves understanding the concept of a stakeholder's use-case and then identify it from the case study. </li>
<li><strong>Anderson &amp; Krathwohl's Revised Taxonomy Level:</strong> Apply</li>
<li><strong>Anderson &amp; Krathwohl's Revised Taxonomy Explanation:</strong> Applying knowledge of use cases to stakeholders involves using the concept in a practical context.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Identify the communication points and action strategies with the stakeholders.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DOK Level:</strong> Skills and Concepts (DOK 2)</li>
<li><strong>DOK Level Explanation:</strong> This task involves understanding the communication points from the influence/interest grid and then selecting the right strategy based on the quadrant.</li>
<li><strong>Anderson &amp; Krathwohl's Revised Taxonomy Level:</strong> Apply</li>
<li><strong>Anderson &amp; Krathwohl's Revised Taxonomy Explanation:</strong> Applying knowledge of communication points and strategies involves using the concept in a practical context.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1)</h2>
<h3 id="prompts">Prompts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base Know-How Level "Low"</strong>: Solve the exercise "Identify all stakeholders and rank them with respect to their influence and interest" based on the following Transcript of the CEO: <em>&lt; copy &amp; paste extension of case study&gt;</em></li>
<li><strong>Base Know-How Level "Medium":</strong>  You act as a project manager responsible for the project described in the following transcript with the CEO of the company: <em>&lt; copy &amp; paste subset of extension of case study&gt;</em>. Create a list of stakeholders mentioned in the transcript and rate their power and interest in the project based on the description in the transcript. Provide a short reason for the rating (1 short sentence). The output should be a table as follows: Stakeholder, Power/Interest, Reason.</li>
<li><strong>Base Know-How Level "High":</strong> You act as a project manager responsible for the project described in the following transcript with the CEO of the company: <em>&lt; copy &amp; paste subset of extension of case study&gt;</em>. Create a list of stakeholders mentioned in the transcript and rate their influence and interest (high, medium or low) according to the power/interest grid and based on the description in the transcript. Provide a short reason for the rating (1 short sentence). Consider a few details that are important: Make sure to identify the people that are part of the steering committee. Bear in mind that the project is about documenting and automating company wide processes so match the interest of the stakeholders according to the project objective. Also consider potential stakeholders that are not mentioned in the transcript but are very relevant in the context of process documentation and process automation. The output should be a table as follows: Stakeholder, Power/Interest, Reason.</li>

<summary>Promp1 (Executed 2024-01-03)</summary>
<p>Solve the exercise "Identify all stakeholders and rank them with respect to their influence and interest" based on the following Transcript of the CEO: Transcript conversation with the CEO:</p>
<p>There will be a steering committee consisting of me, the CFO Mike and the Head of Marketing and Sales Maria. Our CFO is always careful to ensure that the financial requirements are met. But he will not be involved in the project. I think he should always be kept up to date. For me it is important that the quality of the work is high. On-time delivery is of course a must. Regular reports should be sent to the steering committee.</p>
<p>The Head of Marketing and Sales Maria has a lot of experience. She has always a lot of good ideas, of how new products are then appropriately communicated and marketed. If necessary, she will also be the link between product development and customer service. She will be responsible for managing our social media channels for all the organizational units. Also please mind that Maria will be very positive about the project and certainly can bring a lot of positive input.</p>
<p>The Head of Product Development, Production &amp; Innovation Barbara will also have an influence on the success of the project. She has very high standards and is very motivated. She will also appoint a co-worker who will also work on the project. This employee should have experience in creating new products but is very likely to be skeptical regarding external product ideas.</p>
<p>I would also address Franziska the Head of Customer Service (B2B) because she has to distribute the products to the customers and is also the first point of contact for such customers in case of problems. She is very positive about harmonizing processes and has been demanding this project for a long time. She is in general very demanding and of course has very high standards with respect to quality for new products and therefore also for the whole new process</p>
<p>Michael has the same role as Franziska, but he is in charge of customer service B2C instead. In contrast to Franziska, he is not so that positive about the standardization of processes. Rather, he believes that all B2C sales units know their customers best and should therefore design the processes differently. He will observe everything closely. I would communicate quite intensively with him. And, honestly speaking, if things get a bit complicated with Michael, I would definetly ask Franziska for advices.</p>
<p>Surely, also the procurement is important. It has to be very closely involved in the development of new products, because new ideas can only be realized on the basis of procurable technology. The main contact person here is the head Peter. He was one of the main initiators of the project. He observed, indeed, that the procurement processes are very different in the each site. Therefore, he will be one of the most important contacts in this project. </p>
<p>Marko is responsible for our information management. He certainly has to be involved, because all the new ideas have to be processed and documented somewhere. The systemic requirements for this must be clarified with him. He is a technical person and requires rather detailed requirements. But he has a very good technical know-how and will be important for the project. He will always communicate very directly and openly. He will do positive lobbying for the project if he is convinced but may also work against it if he is not convinced. Nevertheless, he is a very important employee for us, because he almost alone has managed the previous system and is very important to us.

<p>You act as a project manager responsible for the project described in the following transcript with the CEO of the company: Transkript Gespräch mit CEO:Transcript conversation with the CEO:</p>
<p>There will be a steering committee consisting of me, the CFO Mike and the Head of Marketing and Sales Maria. Our CFO is always careful to ensure that the financial requirements are met. But he will not be involved in the project. I think he should always be kept up to date. For me it is important that the quality of the work is high. On-time delivery is of course a must. Regular reports should be sent to the steering committee.</p>
<p>The Head of Marketing and Sales Maria has a lot of experience. She has always a lot of good ideas, of how new products are then appropriately communicated and marketed. If necessary, she will also be the link between product development and customer service. She will be responsible for managing our social media channels for all the organizational units. Also please mind that Maria will be very positive about the project and certainly can bring a lot of positive input.</p>
<p>The Head of Product Development, Production &amp; Innovation Barbara will also have an influence on the success of the project. She has very high standards and is very motivated. She will also appoint a co-worker who will also work on the project. This employee should have experience in creating new products but is very likely to be skeptical regarding external product ideas.</p>
<p>I would also address Franziska the Head of Customer Service (B2B) because she has to distribute the products to the customers and is also the first point of contact for such customers in case of problems. She is very positive about harmonizing processes and has been demanding this project for a long time. She is in general very demanding and of course has very high standards with respect to quality for new products and therefore also for the whole new process</p>
<p>Michael has the same role as Franziska, but he is in charge of customer service B2C instead. In contrast to Franziska, he is not so that positive about the standardization of processes. Rather, he believes that all B2C sales units know their customers best and should therefore design the processes differently. He will observe everything closely. I would communicate quite intensively with him. And, honestly speaking, if things get a bit complicated with Michael, I would definetly ask Franziska for advices.</p>
<p>Surely, also the procurement is important. It has to be very closely involved in the development of new products, because new ideas can only be realized on the basis of procurable technology. The main contact person here is the head Peter. He was one of the main initiators of the project. He observed, indeed, that the procurement processes are very different in the each site. Therefore, he will be one of the most important contacts in this project. </p>
<p>Marko is responsible for our information management. He certainly has to be involved, because all the new ideas have to be processed and documented somewhere. The systemic requirements for this must be clarified with him. He is a technical person and requires rather detailed requirements. But he has a very good technical know-how and will be important for the project. He will always communicate very directly and openly. He will do positive lobbying for the project if he is convinced but may also work against it if he is not convinced. Nevertheless, he is a very important employee for us, because he almost alone has managed the previous system and is very important to us. Close and regular contact is very important for optimal cooperation with him.</p>
<p>Christina is our first contact person for all technical and non-technical aspects of both our online stores and our product configurator. She will be able to tell you a lot about the processes. I also believe that she has already modeled quite a few things in the form of a process and can therefore also collaborate intensively in the development of our standardized business process models.</p>
<p>Should further interested parties come up while talking to the already mentioned stakeholders, please let me know.</p>
<p>Please make sure that our business partners are also involved. Furthermore, there has to be at least two people from each organizational unit as the project should have a broad basis.</p>
<p>Create a list of stakeholders mentioned in the transcript and rate their power and interest in the project based on the description in the transcript. Provide a short reason for the rating (1 short sentence). The output should be a table as follows: Stakeholder, Power/Interest, Reason.</p>

<p><strong>Overall observation:</strong> The AI successfully identified all stakeholders and with some hints in the prompt it could also identify typical stakeholders not mentioned in the text which are relevant for the project. However, the rating of the stakeholders according to the power/interest grid worked only partially. The AI failed to put the respective power or interest in relation to the project scope but rated power or interest according to a typical hierarchical structure. Furthermore, it did not successfully distinguish general project interest with interest according to the actual project involvement. Providing more knowledge via the prompt did not increase the quality of the response. </p>

<p>Solve the exercise "Identify the key use cases related to the stakeholders (What will the stakeholder have to do with the solution once it is developed?)" based on the following Transcript of the CEO: Transcript conversation with the CEO:</p>

<p>The Head of Marketing and Sales Maria has a lot of experience. She has always a lot of good ideas, of how new products are then appropriately communicated and marketed. If necessary, she will also be the link between product development and customer service. She will be responsible for managing our social media channels for all the organizational units. Also please mind that Maria will be very positive about the project and certainly can bring a lot of positive input.</p>
<p>The Head of Product Development, Production &amp; Innovation Barbara will also have an influence on the success of the project. She has very high standards and is very motivated. She will also appoint a co-worker who will also work on the project. This employee should have experience in creating new products but is very likely to be skeptical regarding external product ideas.</p>
<p>I would also address Franziska the Head of Customer Service (B2B) because she has to distribute the products to the customers and is also the first point of contact for such customers in case of problems. She is very positive about harmonizing processes and has been demanding this project for a long time. She is in general very demanding and of course has very high standards with respect to quality for new products and therefore also for the whole new process</p>

He will do positive lobbying for the project if he is convinced but may also work against it if he is not convinced. Nevertheless, he is a very important employee for us, because he almost alone has managed the previous system and is very important to us. Close and regular contact is very important for optimal cooperation with him.</p>
<p>Christina is our first contact person for all technical and non-technical aspects of both our online stores and our product configurator. She will be able to tell you a lot about the processes. I also believe that she has already modeled quite a few things in the form of a process and can therefore also collaborate intensively in the development of our standardized business process models.</p>
<p>Should further interested parties come up while talking to the already mentioned stakeholders, please let me know.</p>

<summary>Prompt 2 (Executed 2024-01-03)</summary>
<p>You act as a project manager responsible for the project described in the following transcript with the CEO of the company: </p>
<p>There will be a steering committee consisting of me, the CFO Mike and the Head of Marketing and Sales Maria. Our CFO is always careful to ensure that the financial requirements are met. But he will not be involved in the project. I think he should always be kept up to date. For me it is important that the quality of the work is high. On-time delivery is of course a must. Regular reports should be sent to the steering committee.</p>
<p>The Head of Marketing and Sales Maria has a lot of experience. She has always a lot of good ideas, of how new products are then appropriately communicated and marketed. If necessary, she will also be the link between product development and customer service. She will be responsible for managing our social media channels for all the organizational units. Also please mind that Maria will be very positive about the project and certainly can bring a lot of positive input.</p>
<p>The Head of Product Development, Production &amp; Innovation Barbara will also have an influence on the success of the project. She has very high standards and is very motivated. She will also appoint a co-worker who will also work on the project. This employee should have experience in creating new products but is very likely to be skeptical regarding external product ideas.</p>
<p>I would also address Franziska the Head of Customer Service (B2B) because she has to distribute the products to the customers and is also the first point of contact for such customers in case of problems. She is very positive about harmonizing processes and has been demanding this project for a long time. She is in general very demanding and of course has very high standards with respect to quality for new products and therefore also for the whole new process</p>
<p>Michael has the same role as Franziska, but he is in charge of customer service B2C instead. In contrast to Franziska, he is not so that positive about the standardization of processes. Rather, he believes that all B2C sales units know their customers best and should therefore design the processes differently. He will observe everything closely. I would communicate quite intensively with him. And, honestly speaking, if things get a bit complicated with Michael, I would definetly ask Franziska for advices.</p>
<p>Surely, also the procurement is important. It has to be very closely involved in the development of new products, because new ideas can only be realized on the basis of procurable technology. The main contact person here is the head Peter. He was one of the main initiators of the project. He observed, indeed, that the procurement processes are very different in the each site. Therefore, he will be one of the most important contacts in this project.</p>
<p>Marko is responsible for our information management. He certainly has to be involved, because all the new ideas have to be processed and documented somewhere. The systemic requirements for this must be clarified with him. He is a technical person and requires rather detailed requirements. But he has a very good technical know-how and will be important for the project. He will always communicate very directly and openly. He will do positive lobbying for the project if he is convinced but may also work against it if he is not convinced. Nevertheless, he is a very important employee for us, because he almost alone has managed the previous system and is very important to us. Close and regular contact is very important for optimal cooperation with him.</p>
<p>Christina is our first contact person for all technical and non-technical aspects of both our online stores and our product configurator. She will be able to tell you a lot about the processes. I also believe that she has already modeled quite a few things in the form of a process and can therefore also collaborate intensively in the development of our standardized business process models.</p>
<p>Should further interested parties come up while talking to the already mentioned stakeholders, please let me know.</p>
<p>Please make sure that our business partners are also involved. Furthermore, there has to be at least two people from each organizational unit as the project should have a broad basis.</p>
<p>Create a list of stakeholders mentioned in the transcript and Identify 1-2 key use cases related to the stakeholders mentioned in the transcript (e.g., What will the stakeholder have to do with the solution once it is developed?). </p>
<p>The output should be a table as follows: Stakeholder, Use-Case.</p>

<p>You act as a project manager responsible a project to document company wide processes and automate a few administrative processes using a process automation software. </p>
<pre><code>These are the goals of the project:
•   Preparation of a process map
•   Shared understanding of the process map
•   Development of all relevant processes with our business partners
•   Shared understanding of the processes
•   Development of processes to operate our social media channels
•   The maximum duration of the project is 6 months
•   The budget for the project is 200’000 CHF
•   The relevant stakeholders are involved
•   All processes are modelled in BPMN 2.0

You performed a stakeholder analysis (power/interest grid) as follows: 
- CEO: High/Low 
- CFO (Mike): High/Low  
- Head of Marketing and Sales (Maria): High/Medium  
- Head of Product Development, Production &amp; Innovation (Barbara): Medium/Medium
- Head of Customer Service (B2B - Franziska): Medium/Medium
- Head of Customer Service (B2C - Michael): Medium/Medium
- Head of Procurement (Peter): Medium/Medium    
- Head of Information Management (Marko): Medium/Low    
- Technical Lead (Christina): Low/High  
- Steering Committee (CEO, CFO, Maria): High/Low    
- Business Partners: Medium/Low
- Representatives from each Organizational Unit: Medium/Medium  
- IT Specialist: Medium/High

Based on the list of stakeholders, identify their key use-case what each stakeholder will do with the solution once it is developed. When identifying the key use cases, choose use cases that consider a successful project outcome and are relevant for the role of the stakeholder (i.e., why does the stakeholder want the project to succeed?). For example, Marko is responsible for the Information Management and his primary Use-Case is to implement technical solutions that are maintainable and are in line with architectural guidelines. The output should be a table as follows: Stakeholder, Use-Case.

<td>By providing condensed and summarised information and excluding the actual exercise transcript, the response has a much higher quality and accuracy. Furthermore, the exact specification of what is required increased the quality.</td>

<p><strong>Overall observation:</strong> Even without any specific instructions, the AI is able to provide rather meaningful and average results. The key to drastically increase the quality of the response is by reducing input (i.e., not pasting the whole exercise transcript) and rather provide selected subsets combined with detailed instructions on what has to be delivered. It is even suggested to iteratively work through certain exercises and reuse the output from previous prompts in newer prompts. Furthermore, it is advisable to provide examples of an output that the AI can imitate. </p>
