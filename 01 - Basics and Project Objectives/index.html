<h3 id="prompts">Prompts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base Know-How Level "Low"</strong>: Solve the exercise "Name the project and develop the overall project objective of the project.", "Formulate the overall project objective in S.M.A.R.(T.) way" and "Reflect the overall project objective in relation to the company goals/objectives" based on the following case study: <em>&lt; copy &amp; paste  case study&gt;</em> and Transcript of the CEO: <em>&lt; copy &amp; paste extension of case study&gt;</em></li>
<li><strong>Base Know-How Level "Medium":</strong>  You act as a project manager responsible for the project described in the following transcript with the CEO of the company: <em>&lt; copy &amp; paste subset of extension of case study&gt;</em>. Name the project and develop one overall project objective of the project in line with the SMART-Method. Try to align the objectives with the company goals mentioned in the following case study: <em><copy & paste company goals of case study></em>. As an Output, only write one overall project objective and nothing else. Add a reason why this objective supports the mentioned company goals.</li>
<li><strong>Base Know-How Level "High":</strong> You act as a project manager responsible for the project described in the following transcript with the CEO of the company: <em>&lt; copy &amp; paste subset of extension of case study&gt;</em>. Name the project and develop one concise overall project objective of the project in line with the SMART-Method (1-2 sentences). Make sure that the overall project objective points out the most important objective of the project that best aligns with the company objectives mentioned in the following case study: <em><copy & paste company objective of case study></em>. The overall project objective describes the objective in a very condensed form. Ideally, it is related to a strategic company objective that is supported by the the project.  Here's an example of a good project objective: "Reduce monthly customer churn to &gt;1% before the end of the year." or "Increase our company Net Promoter Score (NPS) to 62 by the end of the quarter.".</li>

<summary>Prompt 1 (Executed 2023-12-28)</summary>
<p>Solve the exercise "Name the project and develop the overall project objective of the project.", "Formulate the overall project objective in S.M.A.R.(T.) way" and "Reflect the overall project objective in relation to the company goals/objectives". </p>
<p>Solve the exercise based on the following case study:  1    The Company 1hPush
The company 1hPush is a company that has been producing power drinks for about 4 years, which push the performance of consumers for an hour. 1hPush was founded in Switzerland and has also been active for two years with production and distribution sites in Germany, Austria, Italy, and France. Our power drinks are produced with regional products (where available), they lead to excellent performance enhancements, and they are offered with a wide range of flavours. In any case, all regional products are purchased directly from the producer at "fair prices" and the complete supply chain and all sources of supply are shown on our website. We are proud of this. We pursue a multi-channel strategy and constantly improve our service and support, while maintaining low product prices across all channels. Customers can access standard products that are available in stores or in the online shop. A standard product, for example, is the extremely popular combination of lime, mint, strawberry, and guarana in the 0.5 litre bottle. One of the company's USPs is that the power drinks can also be individualised online via a product configurator. Companies as well as private individuals can also customise the cans and bottles in their design. Currently, consumers can choose from 5 different shapes of cans and bottles, and they can have their name, lettering, or picture engraved or printed. </p>
<p>1hPush continues to pursue a growth strategy and intends to attract more partners in the retail sector (B2B) as a distribution channel. Furthermore, sales via the online shop (B2C) shall be increased, especially the share of configured products. </p>
<p>In order to realise the combination of high service quality and low prices, the requirements for process efficiency are particularly high. In recent months, there has been a growing awareness that the training of new employees is increasingly complex and that, in many areas, especially at the various locations, processes are not clearly formulated. This takes efficiency out of the company.
 
2   Company vision</p>
<p>•   We are an innovative, dynamic, and future-oriented company that is constantly improving and optimising itself in order to be able to guarantee quality and high service standards at all times.

5   Current situation
In the last three years, we have grown massively. We have established ourselves in five countries, we have grown to 73 employees and increased our turnover by 400 %. We are gaining more and more suppliers for our products and the number of B2B customers is also growing steadily. Each national company orders only for itself and there are hardly any synergies between them. In some cases, we still work with Excel lists and even within one organisation there is no uniformity. The communication with the "community" is growing disproportionately high and, in the meantime, it takes place via several social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. In the future, we want to listen more to our "community" and analyse suggestions that are brought in by the "community". It is essential that we become more efficient across organisations. It is essential that we learn from each other and extract the best in the processes of the organisational units and establish it in all of them. This increase in efficiency should enable us to invest more time in the exchange with our business partners and especially with our community. This will enable us to identify needs even better and act more innovatively.</p>
<p>In order to better manage communication with the "community", a solution is to be procured in the future, which will make it possible to manage all social media channels via this one solution and also to achieve the highest possible level of automated pre-categorisation of content with regard to topics, concerns, etc. This solution must be centrally procured and managed and must be able to analyse the content in four languages.</p>
<p>In the future, we want to be able to handle standard processes efficiently, but at the same time, we want to be able to react to our customers' requirements in an agile manner. To this end, we will develop a process competence to minimise frictional losses and establish a common understanding of the processes. We have no time for inefficient processes, we want to invest the time for our customers.</p>
<p>Here's the Transcript of the CEO: Extension 1hPush – Project Objectives and Requirements</p>
<p>Transcript of the conversation with Sonja (CEO):</p>
<p>Our starting position is that we have grown considerably over the past months. Meanwhile, we have problems designing our processes homogenously. Especially, our processes are – for no reason – run completely differently. This concerns, for example, procurement and how we try to gain new suppliers, but it also includes our work with the “community”. We are currently not able to learn from each other, because neither our processes are documented uniformly and they are partially only known by few employees. We definitely need to change that.</p>
<p>Additionally, we feel that we are not generating sufficient ideas that are of interest for the market. We wish to improve this in future. The project has several dimensions; on the one hand, we want to establish a uniform understanding of processes, and, on the other hand we want to actively integrate a community into the development of new ideas. This concerns, for example, procurement and how we interact with our suppliers and also includes the feedback of existing customers.</p>
<p>Goals of the project are in my opinion:
•   Preparation of a process map
•   Shared understanding of the process map
•   Development of all relevant processes with our business partners
•   Shared understanding of the processes
•   Development of processes to operate our social media channels
•   The maximum duration of the project is 6 months
•   The budget for the project is 200’000 CHF
•   The relevant stakeholders are involved
•   All processes are modelled in BPMN 2.0</p>
<p>To obtain a shared understanding of our areas of operation and to clarify how the activities of each employee contribute to value generation, we want to establish a process map. This is an important part of working together efficiently. For this, we need the approval of the stakeholders of all areas of operation. I definitely want to be informed, should this cause any problems. The process map will not automatically lead to a shared understanding, hence it should be implemented in all areas of operation and be communicated accordingly.  </p>
<p>At the moment, we are working together with our business partners (suppliers and retailers) at times somewhat unstructured and ad hoc. It will be necessary to define and structure the processes for and of our business partners. We should consider what is specific for each country and what can be a common basis across all organizational units. We should extract “the best” of all areas and transfer it to all organizational units.</p>
<p>Since we are growing strongly, it is important for the training of new employees to be able to work in a quick and productive manner. Thus, we will be able to shorten the time of «onboarding» in future. Not only new employees should develop an understanding of the processes, but also the existing employees. Within the scope of the project it should be ensured that the majority of employees understands the processes. It is not about restructuring existing processes, however it is about homogenising and documenting them. There will be no further training within the scope of the project.</p>
<p>The centre of the project is the development of a common vision across all sites regarding the process of operating our social media channels. This uniform process should be defined in a way so it can be automized with a software solution to a high extent. Especially, media discontinuity shall be avoided and all channels shall be operated through one solution and in four languages. It is very important that we communicate professionally and efficiently with our consumers and especially “with one voice”. The evaluation and the concrete elaboration of requirements for a general solution, the evaluation of this solution and it procurement, we will develop after this project in a separate project. We will have enough to do with the development of our processes in this project.</p>
<p>We have a significant budget for the realisation of the project. We also have a tight time frame of only 6 months. It is important that all relevant stakeholders are involved in the development of the content.</p>
<p>In the initial phase, we will not acquire any professional software for the compilation and management of processes. However, the processes are to be documented in BPMN 2.0. The BPMN 2.0 training for employees needs to take place at the very beginning of the project. The idea behind this is that we want to automate more processes in future. Existing processes will not be automated within the scope of the project, however automation potentials may be identified and documented. Regarding the project approach, we remain open, as long as we chose an appropriate method.</p>
<p>The process map needs to be integrated into our intranet (SharePoint). Subsequently, all documented processes will be uploaded to the intranet making them available for all.</p>

<p>Develop “System objectives”, “Process objectives”, “Additional objectives” of the project based on the following Transcript of the CEO: Our starting position is that we have grown considerably over the past months. Meanwhile, we have problems designing our processes homogenously. Especially, our processes are – for no reason – run completely differently. This concerns, for example, procurement and how we try to gain new suppliers, but it also includes our work with the “community”. We are currently not able to learn from each other, because neither our processes are documented uniformly and they are partially only known by few employees. We definitely need to change that.</p>
<p>Additionally, we feel that we are not generating sufficient ideas that are of interest for the market. We wish to improve this in future. The project has several dimensions; on the one hand, we want to establish a uniform understanding of processes, and, on the other hand we want to actively integrate a community into the development of new ideas. This concerns, for example, procurement and how we interact with our suppliers and also includes the feedback of existing customers.</p>
<p>Goals of the project are in my opinion:
•   Preparation of a process map
•   Shared understanding of the process map
•   Development of all relevant processes with our business partners
•   Shared understanding of the processes
•   Development of processes to operate our social media channels
•   The maximum duration of the project is 6 months
•   The budget for the project is 200’000 CHF
•   The relevant stakeholders are involved
•   All processes are modelled in BPMN 2.0</p>
<p>To obtain a shared understanding of our areas of operation and to clarify how the activities of each employee contribute to value generation, we want to establish a process map. This is an important part of working together efficiently. For this, we need the approval of the stakeholders of all areas of operation. I definitely want to be informed, should this cause any problems. The process map will not automatically lead to a shared understanding, hence it should be implemented in all areas of operation and be communicated accordingly.  </p>
<p>At the moment, we are working together with our business partners (suppliers and retailers) at times somewhat unstructured and ad hoc. It will be necessary to define and structure the processes for and of our business partners. We should consider what is specific for each country and what can be a common basis across all organizational units. We should extract “the best” of all areas and transfer it to all organizational units.</p>
<p>Since we are growing strongly, it is important for the training of new employees to be able to work in a quick and productive manner. Thus, we will be able to shorten the time of «onboarding» in future. Not only new employees should develop an understanding of the processes, but also the existing employees. Within the scope of the project it should be ensured that the majority of employees understands the processes. It is not about restructuring existing processes, however it is about homogenising and documenting them. There will be no further training within the scope of the project.</p>
<p>The centre of the project is the development of a common vision across all sites regarding the process of operating our social media channels. This uniform process should be defined in a way so it can be automized with a software solution to a high extent. Especially, media discontinuity shall be avoided and all channels shall be operated through one solution and in four languages. It is very important that we communicate professionally and efficiently with our consumers and especially “with one voice”. The evaluation and the concrete elaboration of requirements for a general solution, the evaluation of this solution and it procurement, we will develop after this project in a separate project. We will have enough to do with the development of our processes in this project.</p>
<p>We have a significant budget for the realisation of the project. We also have a tight time frame of only 6 months. It is important that all relevant stakeholders are involved in the development of the content.</p>
<p>In the initial phase, we will not acquire any professional software for the compilation and management of processes. However, the processes are to be documented in BPMN 2.0. The BPMN 2.0 training for employees needs to take place at the very beginning of the project. The idea behind this is that we want to automate more processes in future. Existing processes will not be automated within the scope of the project, however automation potentials may be identified and documented. Regarding the project approach, we remain open, as long as we chose an appropriate method.</p>
<p>The process map needs to be integrated into our intranet (SharePoint). Subsequently, all documented processes will be uploaded to the intranet making them available for all.</p>
<p>Reflect the objectives in relation to the company goals/objectives (if possible) mentioned in the following Case Study: 1  The Company 1hPush
The company 1hPush is a company that has been producing power drinks for about 4 years, which push the performance of consumers for an hour. 1hPush was founded in Switzerland and has also been active for two years with production and distribution sites in Germany, Austria, Italy, and France. Our power drinks are produced with regional products (where available), they lead to excellent performance enhancements, and they are offered with a wide range of flavours. In any case, all regional products are purchased directly from the producer at "fair prices" and the complete supply chain and all sources of supply are shown on our website. We are proud of this. We pursue a multi-channel strategy and constantly improve our service and support, while maintaining low product prices across all channels. Customers can access standard products that are available in stores or in the online shop. A standard product, for example, is the extremely popular combination of lime, mint, strawberry, and guarana in the 0.5 litre bottle. One of the company's USPs is that the power drinks can also be individualised online via a product configurator. Companies as well as private individuals can also customise the cans and bottles in their design. Currently, consumers can choose from 5 different shapes of cans and bottles, and they can have their name, lettering, or picture engraved or printed. </p>
<p>1hPush continues to pursue a growth strategy and intends to attract more partners in the retail sector (B2B) as a distribution channel. Furthermore, sales via the online shop (B2C) shall be increased, especially the share of configured products. </p>
<p>In order to realise the combination of high service quality and low prices, the requirements for process efficiency are particularly high. In recent months, there has been a growing awareness that the training of new employees is increasingly complex and that, in many areas, especially at the various locations, processes are not clearly formulated. This takes efficiency out of the company.
 
2   Company vision</p>
<p>•   We are an innovative, dynamic, and future-oriented company that is constantly improving and optimising itself in order to be able to guarantee quality and high service standards at all times.

5   Current situation
In the last three years, we have grown massively. We have established ourselves in five countries, we have grown to 73 employees and increased our turnover by 400 %. We are gaining more and more suppliers for our products and the number of B2B customers is also growing steadily. Each national company orders only for itself and there are hardly any synergies between them. In some cases, we still work with Excel lists and even within one organisation there is no uniformity. The communication with the "community" is growing disproportionately high and, in the meantime, it takes place via several social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. In the future, we want to listen more to our "community" and analyse suggestions that are brought in by the "community". It is essential that we become more efficient across organisations. It is essential that we learn from each other and extract the best in the processes of the organisational units and establish it in all of them. This increase in efficiency should enable us to invest more time in the exchange with our business partners and especially with our community. This will enable us to identify needs even better and act more innovatively.</p>
<p>In order to better manage communication with the "community", a solution is to be procured in the future, which will make it possible to manage all social media channels via this one solution and also to achieve the highest possible level of automated pre-categorisation of content with regard to topics, concerns, etc. This solution must be centrally procured and managed and must be able to analyse the content in four languages.</p>
<p>In the future, we want to be able to handle standard processes efficiently, but at the same time, we want to be able to react to our customers' requirements in an agile manner. To this end, we will develop a process competence to minimise frictional losses and establish a common understanding of the processes. We have no time for inefficient processes, we want to invest the time for our customers. </p>

Additional Objectives: Additional objectives are not directly determined, but derive from other objectives.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of such objectives by category: System Objective: The waiting time of a customer at the hotline must not exceed 35 seconds. Process objective: The project will be implemented using an agile methodology. Additional Objective: Gain experience working with agile methodologies. As output, create a table with the following structure: Objective Category (System objective, Process Objective, Additional Objective), Objective, Alignment with Company Goal, Reason of alignment with Company Goal.</p>

<p><strong>Overall observation:</strong> When creating the prompts it is key to only provide the necessary information and to clearly describe the expected outcome. By doing so, it is possible without any prior knowledge to create fairly good project objectives that are reasonably well aligned to the company objectives outlined in the exercise. However, the classification of objectives according to the well known IPMA-Standard did not work at all. Even by providing clear definitions and examples of adequate project objectives by category the AI wasn't able to correctly categorise them and to produce objectives related to the categories "Process Objectives" and "Additional Objectives". </p>
