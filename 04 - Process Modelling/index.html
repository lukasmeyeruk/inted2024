<h1 id="process-modelling">Process Modelling</h1>
<h1 id="case-study">Case Study</h1>
<p>The whole course and all corresponding exercises are based on an overall <a href="block00_Case_Study_1hPush.pdf">case study</a> of a fictitious company named "1hPush". </p>
<p>For this specific block there's an <a href="../pdf_documents/block04_exercise.pdf">extension to the case study</a> mentioned above that focuses on process management in particular process modelling.</p>
<h1 id="exercise">Exercise</h1>
<p>In order to reflect the complexity of thinking to successfully perform the exercise, all exercises have been categorised according to the Depth of Knowledge (DOK) defined by <a href="https://www.synergiseducation.com/blooms-taxonomy-and-webbs-depth-of-knowledge/">Webb's Taxonomy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1. Identify the described end-to-end process of 1hPush.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DOK Level:</strong> Skills and Concepts (DOK 2)</li>
<li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Identifying the end-to-end process involves DOK 2 because the concept of an end-to-end process must be understood.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Compile a detailed process schema including the following: process name, customer demand, process steps, and process goals.</strong></p>

<p>Identify the described end-to-end process of 1hPush and compile a detailed process schema including the following: process name, customer demand, process steps, and process goals based on the following Transcript of the CEO: Transcript conversation with Sonja (CEO)</p>
<p>When thinking about in which situations we have direct customer contact, I conclude that it is in the social media channels and, of course, in sales and then also in services.</p>
<p>The market-driven development of our products is very important to me. It is essential that we are capable of developing new ideas that consider the demands of our customers. From this, we need to derive reasonable concepts for new products. We increasingly learn that many good ideas come from the different social media channels and we need to grasp those in a more structured way in the future. I believe that will lead to a new evaluation process to evaluate ideas and concepts. Still, we need to test the products before we introduce the production to the market. The product development is certainly partially automatable. For example, we do not need to count by hand how many ideas have received the best evaluation, if we aim for something like that in the future.</p>
<p>Since our product development has become relatively complex, the head of products and innovation has received additional support. On the one hand, Marko from information management helps evaluate input and ideas, and, on the other hand, Heribert has just taken responsibility for prototyping and testing. Beyond, Christina is increasingly involved, since the products need to be available in the online shop and via the product configurator. Thus, the new online shop needs to be checked. When we offer a new product, we need to communicate it via the social media channels, but also Franziska and Michael need to become active.</p>
<p>Our customers shall know how we implement new ideas and what innovative products we bring to the market.</p>

<p>Based on the CEO's transcript, it seems that the described end-to-end process revolves around the development, testing, and introduction of innovative products, with a focus on customer demand and interaction through social media channels.

<p>You act as a process manager and you have to identify the described end-to-end process of 1hPush and compile a detailed process schema including the following: process name, customer demand, process steps, and process goals based on the following Transcript of the CEO: </p>
<p>When thinking about in which situations we have direct customer contact, I conclude that it is in the social media channels and, of course, in sales and then also in services.</p>
<p>The market-driven development of our products is very important to me. It is essential that we are capable of developing new ideas that consider the demands of our customers. From this, we need to derive reasonable concepts for new products. We increasingly learn that many good ideas come from the different social media channels and we need to grasp those in a more structured way in the future. I believe that will lead to a new evaluation process to evaluate ideas and concepts. Still, we need to test the products before we introduce the production to the market. The product development is certainly partially automatable. For example, we do not need to count by hand how many ideas have received the best evaluation, if we aim for something like that in the future.</p>
<p>Since our product development has become relatively complex, the head of products and innovation has received additional support. On the one hand, Marko from information management helps evaluate input and ideas, and, on the other hand, Heribert has just taken responsibility for prototyping and testing. Beyond, Christina is increasingly involved, since the products need to be available in the online shop and via the product configurator. Thus, the new online shop needs to be checked. When we offer a new product, we need to communicate it via the social media channels, but also Franziska and Michael need to become active.</p>

<p>Here are a few requirements that must be met when developing the content:
- End to End Process Name: Must relate to a core process within the organization
- Customer Demand: Write 1-2 sentences that customers want products that meet their needs and expectations.
- Process Steps: Write actual process steps and avoid future state sentences such as "develop.. " or "implement..". Write the steps as if the process already exists and do not include names of people.
- Process Goals: Make sure they are SMART</p>

There's no improvement expected here.<br><br>The customer demand is now more elaborate and to the point.

<p><strong>Overall observation:</strong> Although the initial response without any prior knowledge does provide a decent response to start with, it still contains a lot of formally wrong information (e.g., mix of project/process activities, process vs. project goals, etc.). By adding specific instructions the output can be improved and the quality increased. </p>
